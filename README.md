## Description 
For this challenge/project I was instructed to refactor a web applications code.

The Criteria was

* GIVEN a webpage meets accessibility standards
* WHEN I view the source code
* THEN I find semantic HTML elements
* WHEN I view the structure of the HTML elements
* THEN I find that the elements follow a logical structure independent of styling and positioning
* WHEN I view the image elements
* THEN I find accessible alt attributesgi
* WHEN I view the heading attributes
* THEN they fall in sequential order
* WHEN I view the title element
* THEN I find a concise, descriptive title

Also including: 

- Application's links all function correctly.

- Application's CSS selectors and properties are consolidated and organized to follow semantic structure.

- Application's CSS file is properly commented.
